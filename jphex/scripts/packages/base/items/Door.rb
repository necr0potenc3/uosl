# For closed doors, the layer attribute of the tiles has values 0 to 7:
# 0: hinges west, opens clockwise
# 1: hinges east, opens counter-clockwise
# 2: hinges west, opens counter-clockwise
# 3: hinges east, opens clockwise
# 4: hinges south, opens clockwise
# 5: hinges north, opens counter-clockwise
# 6: hinges south, opens counter-clockwise
# 7: hinges north, opens clockwise

# doors are stored as whole sets, so a base id is enough to derive
# all information: they are stored in the above order with the closed
# graphic between the entries, so a full set has 16 entries
